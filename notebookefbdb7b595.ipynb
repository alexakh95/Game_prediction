{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# NBA Predicting Game Attendance and Online Viewership "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["I started this project because of my fascination with the NBA and my love for diving deep into the game through NBA 2K on my PlayStation. While playing, I became captivated by the stats behind each game—like shooting percentages, rebounds, steals, blocks, and assists—and how these elements could shape each quarter’s outcome. This sparked my curiosity about the real NBA: what if I could predict which team would win based on these kinds of insights?\n","\n","Beyond my own interest, this project is exciting because it taps into the global popularity of the NBA, where each game is a complex mix of strategy, performance, and player dynamics. By predicting game outcomes, I can explore the data-driven factors that influence wins and losses, from team stats and player performances to head-to-head records. This project also highlights how data analytics can help us understand and appreciate the game more deeply. I’m thrilled to combine my love for basketball with the power of machine learning, using predictive models to uncover the key patterns behind the world’s favorite
